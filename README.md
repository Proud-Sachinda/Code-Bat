USER STORY 
As a reseacher in the field of chemical engineering I should be able to upload an excel file with results produced from GAMS
and the program should be able to generate Gantt Chart for me using the excel sheet I would have uploaded. I should also be able 
to export the charts to PDF as well other formats.
